        <p>Description: Given a plaintext file with characters and integers, use a hill matrix algorithm to encrypt the file. Pad with 'X' accordingly. Then, encrypt the ciphertext again with a rail fence algorithm. </p>

        <p>By doing this project in Security in Computing, 
        I strengthened my understanding of encryption methods,
        specifically hill matrix and rail fence ciphers, and
        learned how to implement them in C. I also learned how to debug more efficiently
        plan my code more effectively. </p>
