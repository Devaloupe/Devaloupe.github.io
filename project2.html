        <p>Description: Given plaintext, normalize text to be all lowercase letters and 
            convert them and print them as integers and hexadecimals. Then, convert them
            to binary and print the binary. Pad the characters according to given CRC types.
            Then, perform a CRC algorithm and print the result. Finally, print the final 
            message in hexadecimal. </p>
        <p>I learned how to work with binary strings, 
            convert characters and integers to binary and vice versa, and
            implement a simple integrity checker in C code.</p>
